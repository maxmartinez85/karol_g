<p>“I like the way she speaks, very Colombian,” Sandra Julian tells us when asked about Karol G. “From what we’ve seen, she’s a young woman who likes to overcome obstacles and move forward. She teaches women not to let men use us, and to love ourselves so we can love others.” Sandra came all the way from Delaware with her daughter to see Karol G at the MetLife Stadium in New Jersey. This is the second time they see her live.</p>

<p>With her bubble-gum pink hair, her Medellin accent and bichota energy, Karol G came to change the music industry. She’s part of a new wave of artists blurring the lines between Latin Music and Pop Music. Her music empowers women from all around the world, and this year, she got three nominations for the Latin Grammys, including Best Album, Best Song and Best Recording.</p>

    <p>Karol G has had a total of 28 songs on the Billboard Hot 100 charts. “Secreto”, a duet with her ex Anuel AA, was her first song to make it, back  in 2019. “TQG”, her 2023 duet with Shakira, reached the positon #7 and it's been her highest so far. And her latest album, Mañana Será Bonito, was the #1 album for a week and has been on the charts for 30 weeks.</p>

    <p>With her Mañana Será Bonito stadium concert tour, the Colombian artist has visited 12 different cities (including Atlanta, Chicago and Dallas) in 15 different dates, ending in September 28th. Her setlist has over 30 songs from her repertoire, and she’s accompanied by 17 dancers and an all-female band. She was joined by some special guests in some venues, like J Balvin, who sang a medley of his hits with Karol in New Jersey. According to her, Balvin was one of her greatest inspirations in the industry.</p>

    <p>“She’s always very present in a process like this,” revealed Mauricio Cruz, one of the three designers responsible for the costumes worn by the dancers. Mauricio, side by side with Elizabeth White and Alba Melendo, designed, developed and elaborated a total of 66 costumes. 44 of them were sewed in Costa Rica and 22 in the United States. “She’s dedicated 100% to her work and her projects. She’s always been very welcoming. The fact she’s so humble and hard-working makes the difference.”</p>

  <p>While the grosses from the tour as a whole are still being processed, Karol G has already broken a record for her two performances at the Rose Bowl Stadium in Pasadena, California. The reggaeton singer earned a total of $25.4 million, making those nights the highest-grossing concerts ever for a Latin American female artist.</p>

<p>Despite her smashing success, Karol remains genuine and authentic. She broke down to tears after her second to last song during her MetLife Stadium concert. They were tears of happiness; she was moved to hear the whole stadium chanting “bichota” to encourage her.</p>

<p>“Thank you so much everyone. I, marica, feel so happy to know that this thing I’m living is something that surrounds us. It makes me want to stop time, so I can enjoy it”, she said, when she finally found the words to speak. She gradually got her energy back at the top of her game, as she was finally able to announce the last song of the night.</p>
